I'm an **AI-focused** software engineer with 3+ years of experience building end-to-end machine learning solutions for risk, fraud detection, and predictive analytics in production environments. I enjoy designing scalable data pipelines, deploying models to the cloud, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to turn business problems into reliable AI systems.

## 💼 Experience

### Visa, USA — AI Software Engineer (Risk & Fraud Detection)  
*Aug 2024 – Present*

- Built real-time transaction risk scoring pipelines with Python and Apache Kafka, enabling fraud evaluation within 120–150 ms for high-volume card authorizations.
- Developed supervised fraud detection models using gradient boosting on highly imbalanced datasets, increasing fraud capture by 18% while keeping false declines under business thresholds.
- Engineered behavior-based features (transaction velocity, spend variance, merchant concentration, cross-border patterns), improving model AUC by 12% over earlier versions.
- Deployed models as scalable inference services with Docker and Kubernetes to maintain performance during traffic spikes without impacting latency.
- Implemented MLOps monitoring (precision, recall, KS, PSI, drift alerts) reducing retraining turnaround time by 20%.

### HCLTech, India — Associate Software Engineer (AI/ML)  
*Jul 2021 – Jul 2023*

- Delivered end-to-end ML solutions for use cases like churn analysis and demand forecasting, cutting manual analysis effort by ~30% across delivery teams.
- Built data preparation pipelines using pandas and SQL to clean, merge, and validate CRM and transactional datasets, improving data readiness for modeling.
- Implemented and tuned models (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting), achieving 10–15% better accuracy than rule-based systems.
- Automated evaluation workflows with performance reports and error analysis, reducing review cycles by ~25%.
